# Snake Reinforcement Learning

This repository is where I will be designing a training enviroment for the famous Snake Game.

It will also serve as a way of me learning AI and RL systems on my own.

## Methods

### Python

I will be using Python as the main programming language.

## AI Libraries

### PyTorch

The main library I will be using is `PyTorch`, I will not be using `TensorFlow` due to it's requirement of a Unix based system.
